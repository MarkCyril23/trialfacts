    <p><strong>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and the Importance of Exercise</strong></p>
    <p>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) causes a slight but noticeable decline in mental abilities, such as memory loss and impaired thinking. People with MCI have a much higher risk of going on to develop dementia.</p>
    <p><strong>The Power of Regular Exercise</strong></p>
    <p>Previous research has shown that regular exercise may help improve brain health and prevent dementia. This study is dedicated to comparing the effectiveness of three different kinds of exercise on memory and thinking abilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Our Research Aim</strong></p>
    <p>At the Research Centre at The University of Sydney, we are committed to advancing our understanding of cognitive health and finding practical solutions to improve the lives of individuals dealing with cognitive decline. Led by Dr. Maria Fiatarone Singh, our team is at the forefront of groundbreaking research in the field of memory improvement through exercise.</p>
    <p><strong>Get Involved</strong></p>
    <p>If you or a loved one are experiencing mild cognitive impairment and are interested in participating in our study, we encourage you to join us in this important endeavor. By taking part, you'll not only contribute to scientific knowledge but also potentially discover new ways to enhance your cognitive well-being.</p>
